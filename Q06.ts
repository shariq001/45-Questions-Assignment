/*      Question 6
Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include
some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the 
name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and 
"\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace
around the name is displayed. Then print the name after
striping the white spaces. */
