/*      Question 34
Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array,
and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of
printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output
containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
• Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza.
The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like
and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza! */
var favPizza = ["Creamy", "Fajita", "Tikka\n"];
// printing only names of Pizza
for (var i = 0; i < favPizza.length; i++) {
    console.log(favPizza[i]);
}
// printint a sentence
for (var a = 0; a < favPizza.length; a++) {
    console.log("My favourite pizza is ".concat(favPizza[a]));
}
console.log("I really like to eat Pizzas. Pizza comes in a variety of flavours and toppings, \nallowing individuals to choose their favourite one.\n");
