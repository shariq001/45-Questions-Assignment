/*Question 15
You just heard that one of your guests can't make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations.
You'll have to think of someone else to invite.
~ Start your program from ex 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the
 guest who can't make it.
~ Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can't make it with the name of the new
person you are inviting.
~ Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list. */
