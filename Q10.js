/* Question 10
Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written,
and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have
anything specific to write because your programs are too
simple at this point, just add your name and the current
date at the top of each program file. Then write one
sentence describing what the program does. */

console.log(num1 + num2);
// This will add num1 and num2 (This is comment in Typescript)
